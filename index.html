								<h3>Development of optical methods for labelling and anatomical tracing of neuronal ensemble in intact mice brain</h3>
								<h4 style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', Georgia, serif;">- <em>Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore</em></h4>
								<p>
									Clearing of brain using RTF to image the intact brain without sectioning it into thin sections as a lot of information is lost in sectioning and 3D reconstruction of the information obtained after sectioning.  While doing RTF (Rapid clearing method based on Triethanolamine and Formamide) realized the need for a microscope to image the cleared brain. So, started working on setting up of wide field microscope. For setting up of RGB laser, programmed Arduino to switch between different wavelengths of light required.  After doing, the required calculations and alignment of the beam successfully set up a wide field microscope. Future goal of this project is to now add galvanometric mirrors and make it a scanning wide field microscope, which can then be used, for imaging in awake mice during behaviour experiments. Also, Control galvanometric mirror and XY translational stage through Arduino and make a GUI to control the entire microscope using that.

								<h3>Evaluation of Antibiofilm Efficacy of Zno Nanorods</h3>
								<h5 style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', Georgia, serif;">- <em>NIIT University, Rajasthan</em></h5>
								<p>
									Nano materials have gained interests worldwide amongst medical personals due their increased efficacy against microbial infections. However, little is known about their efficacy against biofilms. Biofilms are community-associated bacteria wherein bacteria express different proteins compared to their planktonic counterparts. This leads to high tolerance towards drugs as well as immune system resulting in chronic infections that prolong the therapy durations. The objective of this R&D project was to synthesize and characterize ZnO nanoparticles/rods and compare their anti-biofilm efficacy.
									Mechanical assisted thermal decomposition (ZnO nano rods/particles) was used to synthesize nanomaterial. RAMAN spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, XPS, BET analysis, SEM, TEM and UV-Vis spectrophotometric studies were done to characterize the size and characteristic properties of the nanomaterial. Microbial assays (growth and viable cell counts) and biofilm assays(CV staining) were carried out to check their anti-biofilm efficacy.

								<h3>Synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles</h3>
								<h5 style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', Georgia, serif;">- <em>Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi</em></h5>
								<p>
									Zinc Oxide synthesis using mechanical assisted hydrothermal method. MoS2 synthesized through ball milling, Final product was then Characterized through XRD,SEM and BET, nanosheets were observed from the characterization.   MoS2 was also synthesized through hydrothermal method to do comparative analysis of the two methods.
									Carbon nanotubes coated with tubular MoS2 layer were prepared by hydrothermal reaction. MoS2 was also added into conducting polymer. Finally, Graphene was added to MoS2 through ball milling and hydrothermal reaction. All of these synthesized nanoparticles were then characterized through XRD, SEM and BET.
